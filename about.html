        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Hello! I'm Junning, a software engineer who finds joy in the intersection of technology and creativity. By day, I build elegant solutions to complex problems. By night, you'll often find me kneading dough or working on my latest crochet project.</p>

        <p>My journey into technology was driven by a curiosity about how things function beneath the surface. That curiosity guided me to the University of California, Irvine, where I earned a degree in Computer Engineering and honed my expertise in software development and problem-solving.</p>
        
        <p>After graduation, I began my career at Amazon Web Services as a Cloud Support Associate in Networking. In that role, I found a unique balance between my people skills and technical skills—drawing from my background in customer service to support AWS customers while also deepening my understanding of how cloud services fit together. Helping others navigate complex issues taught me the value of clear communication and gave me a strong foundation in building scalable, reliable systems.</p>

        <p>That experience opened the door for me to transition into a Software Development Engineer role at Amazon, where I could bring ideas to life through design and code. Some of my most rewarding projects included building an ETL pipeline that made data more accessible for internal teams and launching a new widget on the Amazon Thank You Page that helped customers discover products they loved while giving brands a way to showcase their latest releases. Being able to see the direct impact of my work on both customers and businesses has been one of the most fulfilling parts of my career.</p>

        <p>This same curiosity led me to explore the meditative art of baking and the tactile world of crochet.</p>

        <p>What I love most about these seemingly different pursuits is their shared foundation: careful attention to detail, iterative improvement, and the satisfaction of creating something meaningful. Whether I'm debugging code, perfecting a cookie recipe, or mastering a complex stitch pattern, I'm always learning and growing.</p>

        <p>>Currently, I’m exploring ways to merge my technical expertise with my creative passions by building my own small business around crochet and baking. At the same time, I’m looking for opportunities to apply my skills in an environment that values growth, collaboration, and continuous learning.</p>
        
        <p>Outside of crafting and coding, I love discovering new coffee shops, whether at home or while visiting new countries. I also enjoy reading about design patterns—both in software and textiles—and sharing the things I create with friends and family. Sharing what I learn and make with others who are curious about my passions brings me a lot of joy.</p>
